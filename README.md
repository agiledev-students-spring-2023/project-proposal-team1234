# Project Proposal

## Collaboration

Members: Harry Minsky, Joshua Forlenza

### Project title

Concerts.io

### What and why?

Concerts.io is a website that shows you nearby concerts based on your music taste. Users will receive weekly newsletter updates of shows happening nearby and also recently announced shows taking place in the future. Through the website, you will be able to see important details about each concert such as the date and time of the show, ticket prices, age requirement, and a link to purchase. Users will be able to save shows they want to go to and receive reminders of upcoming shows they have tickets for. Concerts.io makes the concert-going experience easy for all users, freeing them from the hassle and worry of missing out on their favorite band's show.

### For whom?

Whether you're a hardcore music nerd or going to your first show, Concerts.io is made for all concert-goers. 

### How?

The system will interpret the users listening history, either through last.fm, Spotify, Apple Music, or a hand-entered playlist and match any and all artists that the user has listened to with a growing database of concerts in a given geographic area(NYC for the scope of the project). It will aim to have it's own calander where users can bookmark concerts and provide links to buy tickets. Furthermore, it will have "pages" to represent concerts where users can comment their interest and follow other users who are interested in similar events. Users will also be able to follow artists and genres they like to receive notifications of upcoming concerts. Users should also be able to submit concerts they know of to add to the database. 

### Scope

The project should fit the scope of the semester deadline. The main development tasks are to 1) provide user authentication 2) take advantage of existing music apis such as last.fm and spotify to parse user listening data 3) provide cross-user interactions such as commenting and following. Meanwhile, there is the challenge of compiling a comprehensive database of concerts, but by limiting the data to just NYC this should be an achievable goal. With 4-6 developers working on building the website, and team members gathering event data, this project should be releasable by the end of the semester
